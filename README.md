# Consistent Explainers or Unreliable Narrators? Understanding LLM-generated Group Recommendations

Repository for the short paper: Consistent Explainers or Unreliable Narrators? Understanding LLM-generated Group Recommendations


## Content:
This repository includes the following:

* **Recsys-short-code.ipynb**:
 
  This notebook contains the code to generate top-10 recommendations of fictitious groups with LLMs. Contains the prompt used in the study

* **Recsys-distance-groups.ipynb**:
 
  This notebook contains the calculation to obtain Euclidean distances within groups. Used in the study to label groups as similar or dissimilar. This notebook also contains the Figure plotted in the manuscript and the histograms of normalized distances.

* **Recsys-Explanation-categorization.ipynb**:
 
  This notebook contains the rule-based categorization of explanations of GRS generated by LLMs in **Recsys-short-code.ipynb**. Fuzzy string matching is used based on a set of keywords. The notebook contains the keywords used in the study.

## Datasets:
 
  * v3-groups_[4]members_[25]items_totalgroups2000 : groups with 25 items
  
  * v3-groups_[4]members_[50]items_totalgroups2000 : groups with 50 items
  
  * v3-groups_[4]members_[75]items_totalgroups2000 : groups with 75 items

  **In the study, we only made use of the first 500 groups of each dataset due to time limitations**
